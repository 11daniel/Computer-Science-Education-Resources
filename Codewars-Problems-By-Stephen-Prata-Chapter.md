# Codewars 8kyu Problems by "C Primer Plus" by Stephen Prata Chapter

## Purpose

Codewars sorts problems by difficulty.  8kyu problems are the easiest.  But this sorting is not specific to the programming language.  In particular, C students learn dynamic memory allocation late in their first semester.  Assigning introductory C students to to "easy 8kyu Codewars problems" is problematic.

This document sorts all 180 8kyu Codewars problems by chapter in Stephen Prata's "C Primer Plus" book.

If you are using this list to assign problems to students, I recommend giving the students the goal of solving a subset of the problems they can theoretically solve.  For example, I believe seven problems are solvable by students after reading chapter 2 of the Stephen Prata book.  Your assignment could be for the students to solve any three of them before moving onto chapter 3.

A huge number of problems become available once the students learn arrays, strings, and dynamic memory allocation (chapters 10-12)

This sorting is error-prone.  As of December 2022 this list should be considered *draft*.  I welcome pull requests to refine the list.  I intend to create Codewars collections for each of these, but want to refine the list before doing that work.
