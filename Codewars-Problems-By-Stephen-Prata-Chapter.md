# Codewars 8kyu Problems by "C Primer Plus" by Stephen Prata Chapter

## Purpose

Codewars sorts problems by difficulty.  8kyu problems are the easiest.  But this sorting is not specific to the programming language.  In particular, C students learn dynamic memory allocation late in their first semester.  Assigning introductory C students to to "easy 8kyu Codewars problems" is problematic.

This document sorts all 180 8kyu Codewars problems by chapter in Stephen Prata's "C Primer Plus" book.  I _roughly_ sort problems by difficulty within each chapter list (easiest first).

If you are using this list to assign problems to students, I recommend giving the students the goal of solving a subset of the problems they can theoretically solve.  For example, I believe seven problems are solvable by students after reading chapter 2 of the Stephen Prata book.  Your assignment could be for the students to solve any three of them before moving onto chapter 3.

A huge number of problems become available once the students learn arrays, strings, and dynamic memory allocation (chapters 10-12)

This sorting is error-prone.  As of December 2022 this list should be considered *draft*.  I welcome pull requests to refine the list.  I intend to create Codewars collections for each of these, but want to refine the list before doing that work.
