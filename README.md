# Swift-Education-Slides
A place for Swift programming language instructors to share slide decks

Pull requests welcome!  Lets create a library of educational Swift slide decks.

1) Each contributor should create a directory and put their curriculum inside that directory.  If they have multiple sets of curriculum, one directory per set is appropriate.

2) Each slide deck should have the copyright and license on either slide #1, slide #2, or the last slide.  I suggest the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/   The slide deck should include the requested attribution also on slide #1, #2, or the last slide.

We prefer formats that can be edited: Keynote and Power Point.  But we accept .pdf.
